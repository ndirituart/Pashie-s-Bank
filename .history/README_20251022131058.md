This is a banking application to practice the following almost normal functional requirements:
~ The user should be able to sign up and log in.
~ The user should set up a pin before performing any action on the system.
~ The user should have their phone number represent their account number (Check if the phone number starts with 0 or 254, or +254).
~ The user should provide a pin for transfers to go through.
~ The user should be able to deposit.
~ The user should be able to withdraw or send money to other users.
~ The user should be able to see their transaction history categorised by deposit and withdrawals.
~ The user should be able to download their transaction within a specific date.

This is a Laravel application so far. Practice for creation of models, migrations, controllers, traits, listeners to the database etc.
When I learn how to use Daraja I may come back to practice here (but tbh, devs told me how you have to email Safaricome before each step for approval so yeah idcðŸ˜‚)

PART ONE (21/10/2025)
